        <h3> How to Help </h3>
            <p>
                One of the most important things we can do to protect trees is to plant more of them. This helps to offset the loss of trees due to natural causes, such as disease and old age, as well as human activities like development and deforestation. We can also support organizations that work to protect and conserve forests, and advocate for policies that prioritize the preservation of trees and other vegetation. In our own communities, we can help to maintain and care for the trees by watering them during dry periods, removing trash and litter that can harm them, and avoiding activities that can damage their roots or branches. By taking these actions, we can help to ensure that trees continue to thrive and provide the many benefits they offer to the environment and to us.
